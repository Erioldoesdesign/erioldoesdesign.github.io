# Hi there I'm Eriol Fox ðŸ¦Š

## I'm a full-stack, Human Rights Centred Designer (HRCD) and PhD researcher from Bristol in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º.

I'm currently working part-time as a product manager for OSS and a designer while I research how Designers contribute to Humanitarian Open Source Software at [Open Lab Newcastle](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/eriol-fox/). You can check out my [portfolio](https://erioldoesdesign.github.io/portfolio/) and [drop me a message](mailto:erioldoesdesign@gmail.com) if you've got a role you'd like to discuss.
[Take a look at my research](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD).

Previously, I was head of design at Open Food Network, Ushahidi and other app, ecommerce and digital platforms for the last 11 years. 

After discovering a love for Free and Libre Open Source Software I started contributing as a Designer to various OSS projects. Most notably at [Open Source Design](http://opensourcedesign.net/).

You can find me online [@erioldoesdesign](https://twitter.com/EriolDoesDesign) on various social media and networking sites.
