# Hello there, I'm Eriol ðŸ¦Š
## I'm a full-stack, Human Rights Centred Designer (HRCD) and PhD researcher from Bristol in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º.

I'm currently working on open government tools at [MadeTech](https://www.madetech.com/) while I research how Designers contribute to Humanitarian Open Source Software at [Open Lab Newcastle](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/eriol-fox/). 
[Take a look at my research](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD).

Previously, I was head of design at Open Food Network, Ushahidi and other app, ecommerce and digital platforms for the last 11 years. 

After discovering a love for Free and Libre Open Source Software I started contributing as a Designer to various OSS projects. Most notably at [Open Source Design](http://opensourcedesign.net/).

You can find me online [@erioldoesdesign](https://twitter.com/EriolDoesDesign) on various social media and networking sites.
