# Hi there I'm Eriol Fox ðŸ¦Š

## I'm a full-stack, Human Rights Centred UX/UI and Product Designer and PhD researcher from Bristol in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º.

I'm currently working part-time as a UX/UI designer and OSS product manager while I work on my PhD thesis centred on how Designers contribute to Humanitarian and Human Rights related Open Source Software at [Open Lab Newcastle](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/eriol-fox/). You can check out my [portfolio](https://erioldoesdesign.github.io/portfolio/) to view my professional design work and [drop me a message](mailto:erioldoesdesign@gmail.com) if you've got a role, paid project or open source opportunity you'd like to discuss.
[Take a look at my PhD research on my open GitHub repository here](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD).

Previously, I was head of design at the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/), [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/) and other apps, ecommerce and digital platforms for the last 13 years. 

After discovering a love for Free and Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS or OSS) I started contributing as a Designer to OSS projects. Most notably at [Open Source Design](http://opensourcedesign.net/) as a core team member. I travel to Open Source and Design conferences worldwide to speak about how design and designers can be integrated into OSS. [See my Youtube playlist of conference talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwz4EueITgvmJzrNWbGkAMeDVLlOWQuch) here and drop me an email to have me speak or run a workshop at your conference or event [erioldoesdesign@gmail.com](mailto:erioldoesdesign@gmail.com)

You can find me online [@erioldoesdesign](https://hachyderm.io/@erioldoesdesign) on various social media and networking sites, primarily the Mastodon Hacyderm server.
