# Hi there I'm Eriol Fox ðŸ¦Š

## I'm a full-stack, Human Rights Centred UX/UI and Product Designer and (drop out) PhD researcher from Bristol in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º.

I'm currently working full-time as a Senior UX/UI designer, design researcher and OSS product manager at [Superbloom](https://superbloom.design/).
My PhD thesis was centred on how Designers contribute to Humanitarian and Human Rights related Open Source Software at [Open Lab Newcastle](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/eriol-fox/) **I'm looking for a new institution that would be a home for this kind of research.**

You can check out my [portfolio](https://erioldoesdesign.github.io/portfolio/) to view my professional design work and [drop me a message](mailto:erioldoesdesign@gmail.com) if you've got a [speaking opportunity](https://erioldoesdesign.github.io/speaking/), senior/manager design role or open source opportunity you'd like to discuss.

[Take a look at my PhD research on my open GitHub repository here](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD).

Previously, I was head of design at the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/), [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/) and other apps, ecommerce and digital platforms for the last 13 years. 

After discovering a love for Free and Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS or OSS) I started contributing as a Designer to OSS projects. Most notably at [Open Source Design](http://opensourcedesign.net/) as a core team member/maintainer. I travel to Open Source and Design conferences worldwide to speak about how design and designers can be integrated into OSS. [See my Youtube playlist of conference talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwz4EueITgvmJzrNWbGkAMeDVLlOWQuch) here and drop me an email to have me speak or run a workshop at your conference or event [erioldoesdesign@gmail.com](mailto:erioldoesdesign@gmail.com)

You can find me online as **@erioldoesdesign** on various social media and networking sites, primarily [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/erioldoesdesign.bsky.social) and the [Mastodon Hacyderm](https://hachyderm.io/@erioldoesdesign) server. I sometimes stream work and OSS stuff over on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/erioldoesdesign) and upload the videos over on [youtube]()
