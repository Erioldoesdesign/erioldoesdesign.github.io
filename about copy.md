Eriol is a multi-skilled, 'generalist' senior designer with 10+ years of experience in design, technology and human rights and has been leading projects and teams for the last 5. They have focused on human centred or problem space-centred user experience (UX) design and research projects.

They have been in-house and freelancing for their a majority of their career and has been working 'end to end' or 'full-stack' since the start of their career.
