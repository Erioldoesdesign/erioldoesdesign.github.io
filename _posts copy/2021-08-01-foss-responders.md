[Foss responders](https://fossresponders.com/) is a community-led project to support (FL)OSS technology projects during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. After the initial lockdown measures globally many (FL)OSS projects and events either cancelled, rescheduled or move to an online model. (FL)OSS organisations also had to layoff staff or greatly reduce their costs to compensate for these expensive shifts in their fundraising models (through events sponsorship and ticket sales).

Foss responders was a collective of (FL)OSS advocates coming together to gather the needs from the community as they happened and respond to them in ways that supported and uplifted the (FL)OSS projects, organisations and communities.

Working alongside other community members in a voluntary capacity I worked on a community-led approach to branding, website design and accompanying needed social and promotional assets.
