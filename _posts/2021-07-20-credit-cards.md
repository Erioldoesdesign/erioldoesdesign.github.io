During my role at Confused.com the Credit Cards re-design was one of the most ambitious projects undertaken on a solo basis.
This project required a complete redesign of the front-end, user journey and back-end infrastructure. I led the project management as well and the visual and UX design on this project as well as working closely with our in-house front-end development resources to deliver the final web solution.

This was the first time Confused.com had fused a series of process into a single project completely in-house for a high-value product and it delivered spectacular results for the product.


The software used in this project includes: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Invision, Usability testing and Front-end coding in Sublime text.
