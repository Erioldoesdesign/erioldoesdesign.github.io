[Foss responders](https://fossresponders.com/) is a community-led project to support FLOSS technology projects during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. After the initial lockdown measures globally many FLOSS projects and events either cancelled, rescheduled or move to an online model. FLOSS organisations also had to layoff staff or greatly reduce their costs to compensate for these expensive shifts in their fundraising models (through events sponsorship and ticket sales).

Working alongside other community members in a voluntary capacity I worked on a community-led approach to branding, website design and accompanying social and promotional assets. I helped with the product management and maintenence of the GitHub Repository that contained our issues and tasks.
