One of the first projects during my time at Ushahidi was additional feature designs and user-testing for the Ushahidi data collection platform in order for the [DREAMS program](https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/hiv-and-aids/technical-areas/dreams) partners to effectively send SMS surveys to multiple beneficiaries.

Alongside UX design, UI design, and user testing prototypes I created some marketing and promotional materials to give out to beneficiaries across Kenya, Uganda & Tanzania.


You can view the open [Adobe XD prototypes here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/f9cfe17d-55fa-42e1-bb90-3bc67f0956a9/).

You can view the [usertesting script, protocol and results in linked issues here](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/2478).

You can view the issue in [Ushahidiâ€™s open-source repo here](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/2451).
