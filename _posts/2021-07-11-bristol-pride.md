Iâ€™m currently on the committee for the Bristol pride festival managing the onsite decor for an outdoor venue that holds up to 10,000 people.

I produced one large-scale banner over 5 meters tall along with two other local artists and arranged the print and installation on the site.

My responsibilities including sourcing and decorating the rest of the site with a mixture of purchase decor and crafted decor including custom painted banners and mounted boards.

I worked with sponsors to represent their brands and supportive diversity messages in print and digital.

Animation featured on a large outdoor screen which were a mixture of celebratory messaging and corporate sponsorship messages.
The software and techniques used in this project includes: Adobe Illustrator, Animate CC, After Effects and hand-drawn media.
