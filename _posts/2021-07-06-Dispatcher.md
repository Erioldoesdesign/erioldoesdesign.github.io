[TenFour](https://www.tenfour.org/) is one of Ushahidiâ€™s suite of humanitarian, open source tech tools. It aims to aggregate communication methods into a single platform in order to reduce comms related mistakes and chaos when a crisis is happening. Developed after a terrorist attack on a mall in Nairobi it is a deeply important problem in the crisis and humanitarian sector in places prone to crisis.

While working at Ushahidi I split my time across multiple products in their suite. I worked on general, day to day improvements for TenFour as well as larger projects such as revamping the onboarding and zero state learning process for users and a crisis alerts set-up system where users can get alerts from official sources fed into their TenFour application in order to coordinate effective communication.

I also took on additional duties in the Team such as product management, repo maintenance and community support when our team resources were constrained.
