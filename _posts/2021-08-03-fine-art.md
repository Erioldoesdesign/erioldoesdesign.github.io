Back in 2004 I started a Fine Art degree. I specialised in new media, installation and digital art but I still exercise my artistic muscles now as well.

I typically make graphic inspired work that mixes 2D and 3D with text and textures. My most recent work uses animal bones with overlaid text, patterns and paint mounted on board or on illustrated bases in frames.

My fine art and traditional illustration work is available for gallery shows or to be exhibited in any space that supports artists. My work can be moved easily around the UK and Europe.
