[‘Open Design’](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/opendesign) aims to learn how, as a design community and an open source software community, we can increase and sustain meaningful design contributions to open source and advocate for designers embracing OSS as part of their learning and careers.
The first phase of Open Design was funded by Adobe’s fund for design while I was Design Lead at Ushahidi. Official partners of the project included Designit’s Germany offices of Berlin and Munich and Adobe XD.
The first phase of Open Design sought to create accessible processes for designers to collaborate and contribute to Ushahidi’s humanitarian open source software. Using Ushahidi’s OSS tools as a testing ground for developing process and tools and understanding some of the driving forces from both the design perspective and the OSS project perspective.

Open Design comprised primarily of 3 months of research, planning and preparation and then 3 months of practical on-site executions and reporting.

In the research, planning and preparation I completed desk-based and interview research that informed a workshop framework, core principles, witness inclusion and design documentation and files ready for open source design contributions. Part of this work included a website and brand identity for the project which was built collaboratively with Designit.

I worked within Ushahidi’s TenFour repository triaging and structuring issues in ways that could entice designers to that project and those issues/tasks.

In the practical sessions, I delivered two on-site workshops in Bangalore, India for Design UP! 2019 and in Taipei Taiwan for Open Up Global Summit 2019. These workshops allowed Open Design to better understand how the developed processes and frameworks worked within the ‘real world’ and offered valuable insight into how to proceed with further Open Design efforts.
