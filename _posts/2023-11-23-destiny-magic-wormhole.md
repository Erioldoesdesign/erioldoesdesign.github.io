## Background and Objectives

The Least Authority team approached Superbloom to support their user testing and user research investigations and benefit from Superbloom staff members experience in open source, digital security software tools across the technology space.

The Destiny tool is a 'magic wormhole' application that is downloaded by a user to send files privately and securely through any internet connection - but gated behind an access code that the Destiny tool generate. Destiny as a tool processes the file sending too - through the 'wormhole'. It connects only to the user that has the generated access code.

I conducted several interviews with high risk individuals across the global that have need of sending incredibly sensitive documents through these means. Understanding what they need is as much understanding basic principles of usability as it is understanding the varied and unique cultural needs globally for privacy and security.

## Impact

We were able to provide a comprehensively investigated report that detailed the critical aspects of the tool that needed improvement from user perspectives alongside a categorisation and ranking of these tasks with estimated effort levels assigned. We also delivered several mock-ups on how to tackle some of these UX/usability issues.


## Outputs
- Recruited, scheduled and conducted 6 user interviews folloiwng high security protocols 
- Detailed findings report
- Mock-up solutions of UX/UI


## New skills
With Destiny I was able to further develop critical security and privacy skills in user research for high risk users/scenarios as well as assessing level of priority according to organisation goals as well as user needs.
