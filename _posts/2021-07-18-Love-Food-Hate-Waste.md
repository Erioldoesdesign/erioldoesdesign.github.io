Love food hate waste are a UK based charitable organisation focused on reducing food waste by educating people on how best to store food, use leftovers and managing their food purchasing.
I created a series of posters for the organisation to use at events across the UK where members of the public could engage with their messages and take a ‘pledge’ to reduce their food waste by taking a suggested action.

The poster images were shared on social media and very popular among the visitors.
