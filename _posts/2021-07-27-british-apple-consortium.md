The British Apple Consortium was a technical masters brief that combined my mature skills in Illustration and design with (at the time) new technical challenges.

This projects called for branding and assets to be built into an interactive webpage. I chose to take the opportunity to learn how to build a site with a parallax scroll function popularised through digital infographics.

All the apple types had a rollover state and animation attached to them. Built using CSS and HTML5.


Most of the elements on the page were animated or interactive and taught the user about the apple supply chain and the challenges the industry faces through interesting interactions.
