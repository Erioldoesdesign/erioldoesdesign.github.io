This Game Jam was a female, non-binary and trans one only. I worked with a team of great people including unity coders and a game designer. I produced the entire suite of characters, illustrations, animations, interface elements and styling.

The theme of this Game Jam was ‘Boundaries’. We worked on a game where you had 4 separate cities with populations you had to lure into the centre of the game space with favourite foods. Once there the populations would mingle and become more tolerant of each other and start to live in other cities and grow to like different foods.
