My traditional Illustration, much like the fine art that I create, helps me to develop and express a visual style that I feel close to. I create hand-drawn works of figures, faces, objects, landscapes and situations and overlay these with hand-written text and textures.

I build these images up in frames and 3D spaces often to further the 3D aspect of the images. When light is shone on these images, they often cast an interesting shadow.

The textures are created and found and printed on clear acetate. I supplement this work with regular still life studies, usually in museums and while out in various cities.

My work is available for gallery shows and in spaces that support artists. Each work is individual and no prints have been made. They retain a sense of individuality.
