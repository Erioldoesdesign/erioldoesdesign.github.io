Compartment was a speculative master brief to create an all-encompassing brand identity for a UK based arts organisation. The goals of the arts organisation was to showcase and feature up and coming artists across the UK online and in free publications.

I created a final logo from several developed concepts and took that style through to merchandise, publications, business stationary and a website treatment.
