## Background and Objectives

This project was a large scale, multi-faceted project that involved design research skills, facilitation with stakedolders, creation of varied design resources and community dissemenation of the content. The organisation I worked for, Superbloom, partnered with another organisation Okthanks and the funder Internews. 

The objective of Adoptable/USABLE Tools was to condust user research with open source privacy and security tool/software (OSS) teams and developers to first understand where the gaps in design knowledge are, where the misunderstandings of design and user research processes are and to learn in what mediums and methods did the developer and OSS community want to learn about design and user research. We also discovered, through the process of user research that the stages after design and user research were difficult for OSS projects to understand and resource time for.


## Impact




## Outputs
- An interactive 'game' experience built in Twinery with illustrations. View 'User testing'




## New skills

I had previously made simple games using [bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) and [Twinery](https://twinery.org/) and joined game jams before but this was my first time coding a full end to end interactive experience in Twinery.
