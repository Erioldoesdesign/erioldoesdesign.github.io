Over the years Iâ€™ve created illustration work for posters, events and personal use.
My preferred Illustration style is vector, graphic fashion and pixel though I am also a digital painter. This style is often more time consuming for commercial work and large format printing.

I support gaming communities and events with poster artwork, logos and merchandise ready artwork regularly. Several of my digital artwork pieces have featured in UK national publications.


I also do personal commissions for artwork for individuals that hang in homes across the UK.

The software used in my digital Illustration includes: Adobe Illustrator, Piskel, Adobe Photoshop, Painter 12, Procreate and SAI.
