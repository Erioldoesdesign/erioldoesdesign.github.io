I carry stories of you is an interactive story about the experience of a carer caring for a terminally ill parent.

The result of 3 months of investigation into ways in which technology and digital media can improve and support the needs of carers, doctors and patients with terminal illness.

Through user research, interviews and academic research I discovered a need for those with stories to communicate them to others, both with similar experiences and those with no terminal illness experiences.

With the permission of my research subjects I worked on a short part of a carers journey, building in interactivity to help the players relate to the subject matter.

This project used my skills in User Research, User Experience, Game Design, UI Design, Illustration and Interactive story telling.

In certain areas of the interactive story, I built in routes to formal information should the users want to dive deeper into medical or support information.

You can download the interactive experience on the [Caring for the Dying itch.io page](https://caringforthedying.itch.io/i-carry-stories-of-you) here for both Windows and Mac. The experience is in Alpha stage and will be developed further.

The Caring for the Dying itch.io page will serve as a hub for any games or interactive stories that aim to communicate experiences with terminal illnesses.
