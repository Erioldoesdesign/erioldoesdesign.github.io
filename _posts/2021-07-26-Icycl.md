Icycl is a frozen alcohol product that is sold in bars and clubs across the UK. I worked on a consultant basis in order to bring the product to life by supporting University of South Wales 1st year students to develop a brand.

I mentored a class of 20 students on behalf of the owners of Icycl and helped refine a final design to take to market.

A final logo and brand guide were the outcomes of my consultancy work as well as a set of next steps for the company owners.
