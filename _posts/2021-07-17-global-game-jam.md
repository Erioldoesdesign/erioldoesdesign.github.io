[Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) is a worldwide event where people interested in making games get together and are presented with a particular challenge or brief and need to create a functioning game out. 2016’s brief was ‘Ritual’

I grouped with some amazingly talented coders, artists, musicians and designers to create a button pressing sequence game with bird characters. I produced the character art and animation for the game as well as contributing to the game design and strategy.

The software used in this project includes: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate CC and Pyxel Edit.
