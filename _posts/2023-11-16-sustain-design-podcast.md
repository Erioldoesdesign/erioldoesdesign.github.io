Eriol has been maintaining the Sustain Design & UX working group since 2019 when at the Sustain conference in Brussels a working group was formed to support design and designers in OSS and to help design be better understood and sustained in OSS broadly.

Maintaining included facilitating monthly community meetings, gathering and curating topics of conversation, managing unique OSS projects that come from the group e.g. [Design Information Inventory](https://unicef.github.io/inventory/design/reading-list/) and sourcing, inviting and interviewing guests on the [Sustain Design & UX podcast](https://sosdesign.sustainoss.org/).
