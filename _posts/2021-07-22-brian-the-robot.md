Brian the robot was Confused.comâ€™s mascot for several years. I worked on several satellite projects regarding the Brian character while at Confused.com.
As well as adverts, digital banners, display and animations I worked on a campaign where there was a printable paper Brian toy and supported the entire campaign through the social channels.

Brian was a real robot and many of the images of him required extension retouching digitally to get the quality of the character looking ready for high-res screens. 
I also did the key photography on TV advert shoots and the subsequent management of the images.
