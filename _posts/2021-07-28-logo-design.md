Through my career Iâ€™ve been approached to create several logos and brands. A sample of such are below and range from individuals like music tutors to kids book series, digital marketing agencies to photography studios.

I believe that a logo/brand should fit the company and intended customer base as opposed to play to the designers technical and stylistic strengths.
