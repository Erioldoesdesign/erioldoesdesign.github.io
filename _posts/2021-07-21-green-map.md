The Green Map project is a global initiative to create maps that don’t rely heavily on the ‘native’ language of the area and promotes a universal language through iconography to be used across the globe. The premise being to encourage people to investigate their local surrounding for eco-friendly alternatives and green spaces to enjoy.

I created a custom printed map on eco-friendly paper to be distributed to 3000+ residents of an area of central Cardiff (Adamsdown). Alongside this was an interactive website and a 3 meter wide permanent, anti-graffiti sign of the map mounted in one of the green spaces in the area.

I went on to create further Green Maps with organisations such as Groundwork and BTCV in the areas around South Wales.
