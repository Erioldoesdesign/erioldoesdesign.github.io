### [Open Design : Designers in Open Source](https://erioldoesdesign.github.io/portfolio/2021/07/02/open-design.html)

### [Isooko : Peace technology](https://erioldoesdesign.github.io/portfolio/2021/07/03/isooko.html)
Isooko is a funded consortium project where Ushahidi was the technology partner in discovering whether technology can aid peacebuilding education/activities. The Isooko project taught me a great deal about how to work with seemingly banal design tasks within a high stress, traumatic context.
