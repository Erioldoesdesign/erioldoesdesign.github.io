# Who is Eriol?

Eriol is a multi-skilled, lead/senior designer with 12+ years of experience in design, technology and human rights and has been leading projects and teams for the last 7 years. They have focused on human centred or problem-centred experience (UX) design and research projects. Problem-centred experience design acknowledges that humans are not always the key beneficiary of design, sometimes we must prioritise security, privacy, accessibility and the environment in our technology.

Eriol has been in-house at organisations and companies for their a majority of their career and has been working 'end to end' or 'full-stack' since the start of their career. This means they work across design roles, starting with discovery, research and product scoping through to sketching, wirframing, protptyping and user testing and on to detailed visual design, interaction design, content design and working through to the development 'delivery pipe' and then working on design quality assurance processes. They self-taught product management when they were in organisations that lacked product management roles.

They are most happy when working as part of a team of technologists in a collaborative and cross-functional way.

Eriol's background was in Art & Design, specialising in New Media and Time-based artwork, they then self-trained into design. They took multiple-night school courses, completed work placements and freelance projects to get to the Lead Designer they are today.
